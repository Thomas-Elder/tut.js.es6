/**
 * This solution is close to gibberish for me. Here's the explanation from the book;
 * 
 * We will use an optional len argument to store the number of character matches 
 * before the current iteration of maxCommon was called. We will use recursion to 
 * process the strings. If any of the strings have a length of 0, either head1, 
 * or head2 becomes undefined.
 * 
 * This is our exit condition for the recursion, and we return len, i.e. the number 
 * of matching characters right before one of the strings became empty. 
 * 
 * If both strings are non-empty, and the heads match, we recursively call maxCommon 
 * on the tails of the strings, and increase the length of the counter of the 
 * preceding common substring sequence by 1. If the heads donâ€™t match, we remove one 
 * character from either the first string or from the second string, and calculate 
 * their maxCommon score, with len initialized to 0 again. 
 * 
 * The longest string may either be in one of these branches, or it is equal to len, 
 * counting the matches preceding the current strings [head1,...tail1] and 
 * [head2,...tail2].
