/**
 * Strings and template literals
 * 
 * It is time to have a look at string manipulation and template literals. 
 * 
 * There has been a shift in the trends of web development in the last ten years that 
 * moves the responsibility of rendering from the server side to the client side. 
 * Therefore, the HTML code that you can see on screen is often assembled using 
 * JavaScript. 
 * 
 * Furthermore, other trends such as isomorphic JavaScript have also emerged, where 
 * full stack developers can use JavaScript to render templates both on the server 
 * side and on the client side. This is why it is important for JavaScript developers 
 * to learn about strings and template literals in depth. 
 * 
 * As a side benefit, template literals are more convenient to use than strings, 
 * especially when it comes to string concatenation.
