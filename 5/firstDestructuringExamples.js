// ?? maybe it's just a trivial example to get the idea across. The example above on 17 looks much more useful.

// let c, d = 5, 3; // here 3 causes issues, the comma after 5 makes things fucky. What about an object... 

// let {c, d} = {5, 3}; // here the numbers cause an issue it expects propertyName: 5, perpertyName: 3, or 5:5, 3:3... 

let {c, d} = {5:5, 3:3}; // so this doesn't error... but c and d aren't assigned values.
