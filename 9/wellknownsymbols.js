/**
 * Wellknownsymbols
 * There are some well known symbols6 defined to access and modify internal 
 * JavaScript behavior. For example, you can redefine builtin methods, 
 * operators, and loops. 
 * 
 * Redefining standard language behavior usually confuses other developers. 
 * Ask yourself, is this skill going to move you forward in your career? 
 * 
 * We will not focus on well known symbols in this section. If there is a valid 
 * use case for it, I will signal it in the corresponding lesson.
 * 
 * Otherwise, I suggest staying away from manipulating the expected behavior of 
 * your code.
