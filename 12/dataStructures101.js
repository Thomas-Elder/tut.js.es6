 * 
 * A set is an unordered collection of distinct elements. An element is said to be a member of the set, 
 * if the set contains the element
 * Adding an element to the set thatâ€™s already a member does not change the set. There are some operations
 * defined on sets. These are: 
 * union: e becomes a member of union( A, B ), if e is a member of A, or e is a member of B
 * intersection: e becomes a member of intersection( A, B ),if e is a member of A, and e is a member of B
 * difference: e becomes a member of difference( A, B ), if e is a member of A, and e is not a member of B
 * 
 * A map is a collection of key-value pairs. If you provide a key, you can retrieve the corresponding value.
 * This sounds very much like a simple object.
 * 
 * However, there are major differences between objects and maps. Objects can only work as maps under very
 * special circumstances.
