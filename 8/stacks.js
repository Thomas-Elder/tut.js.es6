/**
 * Stacks
 * We will need a basic understanding of how stacks work to understand the next section. 
 * 
 * Imagine a stack like a JavaScript array whose elements are not accessible. 
 * 
 * Suppose stack S is given. You can only execute the following operations on it:
 * S.length: checks the length of the stack
 * S.push( element ): pushes an element to the stack
 * S.pop():removes the top element from the stack and returns it
 * You can neither access, nor modify any elements of the stack other than the element at position S.length - 1 (ie the last element).
 * 
 * In Exercise 1, you will have a chance to implement a stack in ES6. 
 */

/**
 * Ok hold up. This is all pretty straight forward, but I want to just implement a quick stack here, to make
 * sure I'm all over it.
 * 
 * It's basically just going to be a wrapper on an array.  
 */

class Stack {
  constructor(){
    this.array = new Array();
    this.length = 0;
  }

  push(val){
    this.array.push(val);
    this.length++;
  }

  pop(){
    let val = this.array[this.length - 1];

    this.array = this.array.slice(0, this.length - 1);
    this.length--;

    return val;

// Ok so this could be a little closer to the bone, but you get the picture.

/**
 * There are two types of memory available to you: the stack and the heap. 
 * 
 * The heap is used for dynamic memory allocation, while the stack is used for static memory allocation. 
 * 
 * Accessing the stack is very fast, but the size of the stack is fixed. A stack frame is created for the global scope. 
 * Then for each function call, another stack frame is added to the top. These frames stack on top of each other. When 
 * executing JavaScript code, you get a stack with limited size to work with. To get an idea of typical stack size limits 
 * in practice, look at this page1 of StackOverflow.com: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7826992/browser-javascript-stack-size-limit
 * 
 * Regardless of the browser, iterating from zero to a million in a for loop is a very easy task.
